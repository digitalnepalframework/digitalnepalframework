## Bordering two of the world’s fastest-growing economies – India and China – Nepal has eight of the world’s highest mountains, an abundance of natural resources, and multidimensional cultural heritage attracting tourists globally. Despite having these enticing features, Nepal has not been able to tap its growth potential due to prolonged political uncertainty.
## That stated, Nepal has made significant progress on reforms with the adoption of a new Constitution in 2015, transitioning from a unitary to federal state, and election of a stable government. The new government’s priorities are centered on development and targeted initiatives to realize its goal of attaining developing nation status by 2022, and middle-income country status by 2030.
